# Wavelet Transform

![main GUI](image/GUI/main.png)

Developed for an undergraduate/graduate course in Computer Vision Fundamentals.

It's thoroughly un-optimized. I tried to make everything work generically for 1D and 2D transforms, but couldn't achieve it completely.

Also, there's 2 bugs I still coulnd't fix. Head over to the Issues section if you think you can help!
